I made this project to make to learn kivy. It's basically just the classic flappy bird made with kivy and python.
I was following Erik Sandberg's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGYMZB_peBM&list=PLy5hjmUzdc0mSEN7WxUQ_HlP6X_OdvMlq)

After finishing the first two parts of the tutorial series I abandoned this project because I wasn't learning much. I decided to make my own kivy project and figure things out on my own.
